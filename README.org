* guile-json

guile-json is a JSON module for Guile. It supports parsing and
building JSON documents according to the http:://json.org
specification. These are the main features:

- Strictly complies to http://json.org specification.

- Unicode support for strings.

- Build JSON documents programmatically via macros.


* Installation

guile-json is freely available for download under the terms of the GNU
General Public License version 3 (GPLv3).

Download the latest tarball guile-json-0.1.0.tar.gz and untar it. Then,
run the typical sequence:

    : $ ./configure --prefix=<guile-prefix>
    : $ make
    : $ sudo make install

Where <guile-prefix> should preferably be the same as your system Guile
installation directory (e.g. /usr).

If everything installed successfully you should be up and running:

    : $ guile
    : scheme@(guile-user)> (use-modules (json))
    : scheme@(guile-user)> (scm->json (json (array 1 2 3)))
    : $1 = "[1, 2, 3]"

It might be that you installed guile-json somewhere differently than
your system's Guile. If so, you need to indicate Guile where to find
guile-json, for example:

    : $ GUILE_LOAD_PATH=/usr/local/share/guile/site guile

A pkg-list.scm file is also provided for users of the
Guildhall/Dorodango packaging system.
